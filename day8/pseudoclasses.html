    <center><h2>PSEUDO CLASSES</h2></center>
    <p>In CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), pseudo-classes are keywords added to selectors that specify a special state of the selected elements. They are used to apply styles to elements in a specific condition that cannot be targeted with simple selectors. 

        Here are some common pseudo-classes and their purposes: <br>
        
        1. **`:hover`**: Applies styles when the user hovers over an element with a pointing device.
           ```css <br>
           a:hover {
             color: red;
           }
           ```
        <br>
        2. **`:active`**: Applies styles when an element is activated by the user, such as when a link is being clicked.
           ```css <br>
           a:active {
             color: green;
           }
           ```
        <br>
        3. **`:focus`**: Applies styles when an element has focus, like when a user clicks on a form input.
           ```css <br>
           input:focus {
             border-color: blue;
           }
           ```
        <br>
        4. **`:visited`**: Applies styles to links that have been visited by the user.
           ```css <br>
           a:visited {
             color: purple;
           }
           ```
        <br>
        5. **`:first-child`**: Applies styles to the first child of a parent element.
           ```css <br>
           p:first-child {
             font-weight: bold;
           }
           ```
        <br>
        6. **`:last-child`**: Applies styles to the last child of a parent element.
           ```css <br>
           p:last-child {
             margin-bottom: 0;
           }
           ```
        <br>
        7. **`:nth-child(n)`**: Applies styles to the nth child of a parent element. `n` can be a number, keyword, or formula.
           ```css <br>
           li:nth-child(2) {
             color: blue;
           }
           ```
        <br>
        8. **`:nth-of-type(n)`**: Similar to `:nth-child`, but only targets elements of a specific type.
           ```css <br>
           p:nth-of-type(2) {
             color: red;
           }
           ```
        <br>
        9. **`:not(selector)`**: Applies styles to elements that do not match the specified selector.
           ```css <br>
           div:not(.special) {
             background-color: lightgray;
           }
           ```
        <br>
        10. **`:checked`**: Applies styles to input elements (like checkboxes or radio buttons) that are checked.
            ```css <br>
            input:checked {
              background-color: yellow;
            }
            ```
        <br>
        Pseudo-classes can be combined with other selectors to create more specific rules. For example:
        ```css <br>
        button:hover:active {
          background-color: darkblue;
        }<br>
        In this case, the button will change to dark blue when it is both hovered over and actively being clicked.</p>
